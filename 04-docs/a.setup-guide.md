### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **System Requirements**  
Before you start, make sure your machine meets these minimum requirements:

- **CPU**: Quad-core (Intel i5/i7 or AMD equivalent)
- **RAM**: 16GB+ (Recommended if you plan to run multiple virtual machines)
- **Storage**: 100GB+ free space (SSD is preferred for better performance)
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux

üí° **Tip**: If your local machine doesn‚Äôt meet these specs, you can use cloud-based platforms like **AWS**, **Azure**, or **Google Cloud** for virtualisation.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Azure Setup & Configuration**  
Here‚Äôs how to set up your Azure environment:

üîπ **Setting Up Azure Subscription & Virtual Machine**  
1. Sign up for a free Microsoft Azure account.  
2. Follow the [Azure VM Setup Guide](01-azure-setup/a.vm-configuration.md) to deploy your first Virtual Machine (VM).  
3. Configure the VM to act as a honeypot for traffic monitoring.  
4. Make sure your VM has the right security settings for a controlled environment.

üîπ **Setting Up Log Analytics Workspace**  
1. Create a Log Analytics Workspace to collect and store logs.  
2. Follow the [Log Analytics Setup Guide](01-azure-setup/b.log-analytics-setup.md).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Log Collection & Analysis**  
- üîπ **Forwarding Logs to Log Analytics Workspace**  
    1. Follow the [Log Forwarding Configuration Guide](02-log-analysis/a.log-forwarding.md) to configure your VM to send logs to your Log Analytics Workspace.  
    2. Use **Microsoft Sentinel** to process these logs.

- üîπ **Querying Logs with KQL**  
    Learn how to query the logs using **KQL (Kusto Query Language)** by following the [KQL Queries Guide](02-log-analysis/b.kql-queries.md).

- üîπ **Uploading Geolocation Data**  
    Enrich your logs by adding **Geolocation Data**. Follow the [Geolocation Data Upload Guide](02-log-analysis/c.geolocation-data.md).

- üîπ **Inspecting Enriched Logs & Attack Sources**  
    Follow the [Attack Source Analysis Guide](02-log-analysis/d.attack-source-analysis.md) to inspect the enriched logs and look for potential threats.
