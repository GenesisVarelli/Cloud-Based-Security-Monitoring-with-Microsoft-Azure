## Project Summary

### Purpose  
This project is about setting up a **cloud-based Security Operations Centre (SOC)** using **Microsoft Azure** and **Microsoft Sentinel**. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with cloud security, threat detection, and incident response. We use a **Virtual Machine (VM)** as a honeypot to simulate attacks and send logs to **Microsoft Sentinel** for analysis.

### Project Overview  
This project helps solve the problem of gaining practical cloud security experience. Itâ€™s designed for anyone starting in cybersecurity, offering a simple way to set up a SOC and work with real-world data. By analysing logs from a honeypot in **Microsoft Sentinel**, I got the chance to practice detecting threats and responding to security incidents.

### Technical Details  
- **Platform**: **Microsoft Azure** (Free Tier)  
- **Tools**: **Microsoft Sentinel**, **KQL (Kusto Query Language)**  
- **Key Features**: Forwarding logs, creating an **Attack Map**, incident response  
- **Challenges**: Configuring log forwarding and using **KQL queries** to analyse data

### Learning Outcomes  
- Learned how to set up a basic cloud SOC  
- Gained skills in **KQL** for querying log data  
- Practiced creating and responding to incidents in **Microsoft Sentinel**

### Future Work  
- Plan to automate incident response with **Playbooks**  
- Explore integrating more security tools for better analysis  
- Work on simulating more advanced attack scenarios
